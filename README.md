# Image-Finder-and-Click
 This program is designed to find an image, move the mouse towards it, and click.
 This program was initially designed to auto-click the shake button in the Roblox game "Fisch" but this could be applied to other needs.

 Thanks to Coding 101 with Steve and Kian Brose for the basics!
