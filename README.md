# Image-Finder-and-Click
 This program is designed to find an image, move the mouse towards it, and click.
 This program was initially designed to auto-click the shake button in the Roblox game "Fisch" but this could be applied to other needs.

 Thanks to Coding 101 with Steve and Kian Brose for the basics!

 The program is a work in progress.

 bot.py will have the most completed code.
